# 🌟 Langstar

**Langstar** is a visual platform that enables both developers and non-developers to easily create **LLM-based agent models** using **drag-and-drop** components. Once built, these models can be automatically converted into **Python code** for deployment.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Lower the barrier to entry for non-developers working with LLM agents  
- Allow intuitive, drag-and-drop-based visual modeling  
- Automatically generate clean, modular Python code  
- Enable one-click deployment and testing  
- Save development time and promote accessibility

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Visual editor for building agent workflows with drag-and-drop  
- ✅ Modular components: LLMs, Tools, Memory, and custom logic blocks  
- ✅ Auto-generation of Python code from visual flows  
- ✅ One-click deployment (e.g., FastAPI, Streamlit)  
- ✅ Project saving and loading for version management
